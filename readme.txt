1) Unzipped the dataset from google drive
2) Used dataloader from pytorch to convert the test and train images to tensor.
3) Applied VGG encoder to tensor
4) Inserted last layer of 4 neurons and trained the last layer.
5) Applied genetic algorithm to find best weights
6) Compared Adam, GD , SGD and Genetic Algorithm performance on our dataset
